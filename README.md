2D data structure visualizer;

[07/01/2026]
-Created Sorting class and declared functions (incomplete)
-Set up window(complete)
-Testing with Insertion Sort(incomplete)

Tasks:
-fix bug in drawing insertion function
-figure out how to not use function instead of function coze of cost (optimize)
-make sure it is working and create class logic seperate
-divide your main class to sorting then create child each represents each sorting method

-finished two algorithms (insertion,Selection) fully working
-introduced inline to draw function so instead of passing function to other function little bit optimized

Tasks:
-adding at least another 2 algorithms 
-specifying what my Sorting class do
- implementing simple Time Compl.
